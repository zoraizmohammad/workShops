Disposable email domains can't make use of OpenAI, therefore users will encounter errors with using MindsDB's integration with OpenAI.

To check if your email domain is disposable, you can verify it on [QuickEmailVerification](https://quickemailverification.com/tools/disposable-email-address-detector) or [VerifyEmail.IO](https://verifymail.io/domain/ipnuc.com).
