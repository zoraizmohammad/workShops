## Description

The `USE integration_name` statement provides an option to use the connected
datasources and `SELECT` from the database tables. Even if you are
connecting to MindsDB as MySQL database, you will still be able to `SELECT` from your database.

## Syntax

To connect to your database `USE` the created datasource:

```sql
USE integration_name;
```

Then, simply `SELECT` from the tables:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
