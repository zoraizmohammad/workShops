In this section, we present how to connect PayPal to MindsDB.

[PayPal](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/guide-to-using-paypal/) is an online payment system that makes paying for things online and sending and receiving money safe and secure.

Data from PayPal can be utilized within MindsDB to train models and make predictions about your transactions.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using [PayPal-Python-SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Python-SDK), the Python SDK for PayPal RESTful APIs.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `mode`: The mode of the PayPal API. Can be `sandbox` or `live`.
* `client_id`: The client ID of the PayPal API.
* `client_secret`: The client secret of the PayPal API.

To connect to PayPal using MindsDB, the following CREATE DATABASE statement can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE paypal_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'paypal',
PARAMETERS = {
  "mode": "your-paypal-mode",
  "client_id": "your-paypal-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-paypal-client-secret"
};
```

WHERE state ="CREATED" 
LIMIT 5
```

WHERE state = 'APPROVED'
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 5
```

Payouts:

```
