## Description

The `runQuery()` function executes a query given as its argument directly in MindsDB. And the native queries syntax ensures that the query is executed directly on the connected data source.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```
const query = `SELECT * FROM datasource_name (<native query here>)`;
const queryResult = await MindsDB.SQL.runQuery(query);
```
