## Description

In MindsDB, files are treated as tables. These are stored in the default `files` database. To delete a file, you must save this `files` database into a variable and then, run the `tables.drop()` function on it.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```sql
files = server.get_database('files')
files.tables.drop('file_name')
```
