## Advanced Installation

Instead of using the `pip install mindsdb_sdk` command, you can install it by cloning the [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb_python_sdk). Then you should create a virtual environment, install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file, and run tests as instructed below.

To test all the components, go to the project directory (`mindsdb_sdk`) and run the below command:

```bash
env PYTHONPATH=./ pytest
```

To generate the API documentation, run the below commands:

```bash
pip install sphinx
cd docs
make html
```

The documentation is generated in the `docs/build/html` folder.
