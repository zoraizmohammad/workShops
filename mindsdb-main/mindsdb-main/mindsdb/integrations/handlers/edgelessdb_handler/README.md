# EdgelessDB Handler

This is the implementation of the EdgelessDB Handler for MindsDB.

## EdgelessDB
EdgelessDB is an open-source MySQL-compatible database for confidential computing. EdgelessDB runs entirely inside runtime-encrypted Intel SGX enclaves. In contrast to other databases, EdgelessDB ensures that all data is always encryptedâ€”in memory as well as on disk. EdgelessDB has no storage constraints and delivers close to native performance.

Central to EdgelessDB is the concept of a manifest. The manifest is defined in JSON and is similar to a smart contract. It defines the initial state of the database, including access control, in an attestable way.

## Implementation

This handler was implemented by extending mysql connector.

The required arguments to establish a connection are:

* `host`: the host name of the EdgelessDB connection 
* `port`: the port to use when connecting 
* `user`: the user to authenticate 
* `password`: the password to authenticate the user
* `database`: database name

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to a EdgelessDB server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE edgelessdb_datasource
WITH ENGINE = "EdgelessDB",
PARAMETERS = { 
  "user": "root",
  "password": "password",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 8080,
  "database": "test"
}
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM edgelessdb_datasource.test LIMIT 10;
```
